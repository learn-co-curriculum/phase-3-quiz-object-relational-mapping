# ORM: Mapping

To set a constant that contains a connection to a database, which syntax should be used?

## Correct

```
DB = {:conn => SQLite3::Database.new("db/database.db")}
```

> Correct! We set up a constant, DB, that is equal to a hash that contains our
> connection to the database.

## Incorrect

```
DB = {:conn => SQLite3::Database("db/database.db")}
```

> Almost. We haven't created an instance of the Database.

## Incorrect

```
db = {:conn => SQLite3::Database.new("db/database.db")}
```

> Not quite. How do we declare a constant?

## Incorrect

```
DB = {conn => SQLite3::Database.new("db/database.db")}
```

> This will actually produce an error: `undefined local variable or method conn`.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
