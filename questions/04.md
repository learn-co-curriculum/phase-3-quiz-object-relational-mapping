# ORM: Mapping

Consider a table with the following columns:

```txt
| id | make | model |
```

Which code snippet creates a class with instance methods mapped to these table
columns, following ORM conventions?

## Correct

```rb
class Car

  attr_accessor :make, :model, :id

  def initialize(make, model, id=nil)
    @id = id
    @make = make
    @model = model
  end

end
```

> Correct! All of the attributes have setters and getters, and the id is set to
> `nil` because it should only be set after the record is saved to the database.

## Incorrect

```rb
class Car

  attr_accessor :make, :model, :id

  def initialize(make, model, id)
    @id = id
    @make = make
    @model = model
  end

end
```

> Hmm, something is missing. Take a look at the id. The id shouldn't be saved
> until after the record has been saved to the database.

## Incorrect

```rb
class Car

  def initialize(make, model, id=nil)
    @id = id
    @make = make
    @model = model
  end

end
```

> Something is not quite right. How can we get and set the attributes (e.g. id,
> make, model) on an instance?

## Incorrect

```rb
class Car

  def initialize(make, model, id)
    @id = id
    @make = make
    @model = model
  end

end
```

> There are a couple things wrong here. We are forgetting to do something with the
> id, and we have no way of accessing the attributes on an instance. How can we
> fix this?

## Incorrect

I don't know.
